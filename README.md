# libretro_volume_fixes

These per-game core options will re-balance the volume in order to have less loud sound effects and enjoing the BGM more.

installation:
 1. make sure you are using a build of the [libretro cores with my PRs for per-channel volume options](http://eadmaster.altervista.org/wordpress/archives/90);
 2. download [this archive](https://github.com/eadmaster/libretro_volume_fixes/archive/main.zip) and extract in your Retroarch `/config` dir (make sure the matching cores `.opt` files are there). 
 3. the volume fixes will autoload with the supported games and cores.
