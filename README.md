# libretro_volume_fixes

usage:
 1. make sure you are using the latest versions of the [libretro cores with my PRs for per-channel volume options](http://eadmaster.altervista.org/wordpress/archives/90);
 2. download [this archive](https://github.com/eadmaster/libretro_volume_fixes/archive/main.zip) and extract in your Retroarch config dir.
 3. the volume fixes will autoload with the supported games.
 
Please note that the other core options will reset to default. If you want to use some non-default option you must manually set it again or modify these presets.
